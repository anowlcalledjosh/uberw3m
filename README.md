# uberw3m

A w3mimgdisplay emulator for ueberzug.

Use by prepending `uberwrap` to your application's command-line, and
install a symlink such that when the application runs `w3mimgdisplay`,
the `uberw3m` script in this repository is executed instead.

uberw3m tries to implement the w3mimgdisplay protocol as documented by
this blog post: <https://blog.z3bra.org/2014/01/images-in-terminal.html>
